# APCronEnsure

## Introduction

AP Classroom has many flaws. One of which is how it will not notify you when you are assigned something.

This program aims to both solve that issue, as well as allow for auto-answer (due to AP Classroom's negligence as seen [here](https://help.learnosity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001679477-Testing-Security-Best-Practices) under Strip validation data)

## What this program is planned to do

1. Save credentials -- unsafe, but required, unsure how the new system works currently, so tokens may be needed
2. Automatically answer, but not submit questions with validation
3. Notify users (via different methods, I'm thinking right now email, Matrix bot, Discord bot, IRC bot) when there is an assignment
4. Automatically "watch" videos that are assigned, as AP is too strict in watching the whole thing (yes, I did watch the video, minus the last three seconds)
5. Possibly have a web interface
